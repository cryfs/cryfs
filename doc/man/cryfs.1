.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B CryFS
encrypts your files, so you can safely store them anywhere.
.PP
.
The goal of CryFS is not only to keep file contents, but also
file sizes, metadata and directory structure confidential.
CryFS uses
.B encrypted same-size blocks
to store both the files themselves and the block's relations to another.
These blocks are stored as individual files in the base directory,
which can then be synchronized with cloud services such as Dropbox.
.PP
.
The blocks are encrypted using a random key, which is stored in a
.B configuration file
encrypted by the user's passphrase.
By default, it will be stored together with the data in the base directory,
but you can choose a different location if you do not want it in your cloud
or when using a weak passphrase.
.
.
.
.SH USING CRYFS
.
.SS Selecting base and mount directories
.
While you can access your files through your
.B mount directory,
CryFS actually places them in your
.B base directory
after encrypting.
CryFS will encrypt and decrypt your files 'on the fly' as they are accessed,
so files will never be stored on the disk in unencrypted form.
.PP
.
You can choose any empty directory as your base, but your mount directory
should be outside of any cloud storage, as your cloud may try to sync your
(temporarily mounted) unencrypted files as well.
.
.SS Setup and usage of your encrypted directory
.
.TP
Creating and mounting your encrypted storage use the same command-line syntax:
.B cryfs
.I basedir mountpoint
.PP
.
If CryFS detects an encrypted storage in the given base directory, you will
be asked for the passphrase to unlock and mount it. Otherwise, CryFS will
help you with creating one, just follow the on-screen instructions.
.PP
.
.TP
After you are done working with your encrypted files, unmount your storage \
with the command
.B fusermount -u
.I mountpoint
.
.
.SS Changing your passphrase
.
As the encryption key to your CryFS storage is stored in your configuration
file, it would be possible to re-encrypt it using a different passphrase
(although this feature has not been implemented yet).
.PP
.
However, this does not change the actual encryption key of your storage, so
someone with access to the old passphrase and configuration file (for example
through the file history of your cloud or your file system) could still access
your files, even those created after the password change.
.PP
.
For this reason, the recommended way to change your passphrase is to create a
new CryFS storage with the new passphrase and move your files from the old to
the new one.

.SH OPTIONS
.
.SS Getting help
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.
Show a help message containing short descriptions for all options.
.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-show\-ciphers\fR
.
Show a list of all supported encryption ciphers.
.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.
Show the CryFS version number.
.
.
.SS Encryption parameters
.
.TP
\fB\-\-blocksize\fR \fIarg\fR
.
Set the block size to \fIarg\fR bytes. Defaults to
.BR 32768 .
.br
 \" Intentional space
.br
A higher block size may help reducing the file count in your base directory
(especially when storing large files), but will also waste more space when
storing smaller files.
.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-cipher\fR \fIarg\fR
.
Use \fIarg\fR as the cipher for the encryption. Defaults to
.BR aes-256-gcm .
.
.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR \fIfile\fR
.
Use \fIfile\fR as configuration file for this CryFS storage instead of
\fIbasedir\fR/cryfs.config
.
.
.SS General options
.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-foreground\fI
.
Run CryFS in the foreground. Stop using CTRL-C.
.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-allow-filesystem-upgrade\fI
.
Allow upgrading the file system if it was created with an old CryFS version. After the upgrade, older CryFS versions might not be able to use the file system anymore.
.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-logfile\fR \fIfile\fR
.
Write status information to \fIfile\fR. If no logfile is given, CryFS will
write them to syslog in background mode, or to stdout in foreground mode.
.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-unmount\-idle\fR \fIarg\fR
.
Unmount automatically after \fIarg\fR minutes of inactivity.
.
.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.
.TP
\fBCRYFS_FRONTEND\fR=noninteractive
.
With this option set, CryFS will only ask for the encryption passphrase once.
Instead of asking the user for parameters not specified on the command line,
it will just use the default values. CryFS will also not ask you to confirm
your passphrase when creating a new CryFS storage.
.br
 \" Intentional space
.br
Set this environment variable when automating CryFS using external tools or
shell scripts.
.
.
.TP
\fBCRYFS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK\fR=true
.
By default, CryFS connects to the internet to check for known security
vulnerabilities and new versions. This option disables this.
