// The fuse behaviour is: For each open(), there will be exactly one call to release().
// Directly before this call to release(), flush() will be called. After flush() returns,
// the ::close() syscall (in the process using the filesystem) returns. So the fuse release() call is
// called asynchronously afterwards. Errors have to be returned in the implementation of flush().

// Citing FUSE spec:
//  1) Flush is called on each close() of a file descriptor.
//  2) Filesystems shouldn't assume that flush will always be called after some writes, or that if will be called at all.
// I can't get these sentences together. For the test cases here, I go with the first one and assume that
// flush() will ALWAYS be called on a file close.
